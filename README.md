# Python_Helper_Files
This is some of the files I have created for my digital assignments, to make my life easier. This is public to make my classmates lives easier.

If you want to use some of this code, feel free, just don't try pass it off as your own.

Current Inclusions:
- Email Handler, allows you to create, edit and send and upload files to an email
- Handler for spotify API (Under development)
- JSONFileHandler (Created to help someone) -- Very basic
